# CSC6301 - A Miller
# Project05 - Stack Sorting Program

## Overview
This project implements a Java program that reads a list of integer numbers from standard input, stores them in a Stack, and then sorts the Stack from smallest to largest using the Java Collections Framework. This maintenance task adapts the previous LinkedList-based implementation (Project 04) to now use a Stack.

## Features
- Reads integer input until a non-integer is entered.
- Uses a `Stack<Integer>` to store values.
- Sorts the Stack in ascending order with `Collections.sort()`.
- Provides clear Javadoc documentation for code maintainability.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or later
- Command line access (or VS Code integrated terminal)

## How to Compile and Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac SortedStackApp.java
